; Repository list for minecraft jar file updates
;
; Lines containing a semicolon (";") are being ignored, so use them for comments only
; The file's parser expects the following file structure:
; Each repo has it's own single line and contains
; <URL_to_repo_file>#<repo_name>
; So avoid using hash signs ("#") in URLs or repo names as well.
;
; Both following entries provide updates for the CraftBukkit plugin container
; and the original minecraft server.
; if you do not want to use one of them, just comment the appropriate one out,
; or delete the appropriate one.
