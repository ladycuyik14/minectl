BUGS
	If you have experience with shell scripting (in fact you should have, 
	when you run a linux server), feel free to study and modify the shell
	scripts. I tried to do some helpful documentation in form of source code
	comments. If you have problems understanding this or that or experience 
	any bugs, feel free to write me an email to <mail@richard-neumann.de>. 
	NOTE: The more detailed you describe the problem, the quicker i can fix it.
